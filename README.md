## ScrapeApp

This application is a result of a Web Scraping/Tkinter exercise in Python. It scrapes data from Wikipedia for the given artist, finds the discography and presents it in a user-friendly format.

To launch the application start window, execute the file `app.py`, located in the root directory:

```
./app.py
```

From this page, one can go to the main application page by following the instructions on the GUI. To search for an artist, the user needs to enter the artist name into the entry box in the main page (first letters in capital), and the discography will show up as an output.
